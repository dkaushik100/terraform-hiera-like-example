# Applications

This folder defines the services to deploy, and the configuration for each one, with one service per `yaml` file. Overrides for specific regions and environments are defined for some services. This very loosely mimics the approach used with Hiera. See the [`ecs-services` module](../modules/ecs-services) for details.
